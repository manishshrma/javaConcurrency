creating 10 threads for 10 independent jobs to be performed, may generate memory utilizaton issues.
Thus instead create ThreadPool.
ThreadPool have already created threads in the pool.ThreadPool framework AKA Executor Framework.

ExecutorService service=Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3)- this line created a pool of 3 thread.
Now, submit a job to this executor framework
service.submit(job) -job here is runnable job
After completing the job, shutdown the executor service
service.shutdown() - shutdown the service.

Note Thread run method never return anything, if want to return the Object use Callable instead of runnable
and call instead of run method.

*Future object to hold the return value from call() method inside the thread implementing callable.
